            <h2>Precautions to be followed by pregnant women.</h2>
            <div class="read-more-par">
              <p>
                Pregnant women are exceptional beings who carry life and are
                responsible for the growth and development of a newborn. During
                pregnancy, it is important for women to take care of their
                health and well-being to ensure a healthy and successful
                pregnancy. <br />Pregnancy is a time of transformation for a
                woman's body, and it's important to understand the changes that
                occur during this time. Hormones are constantly changing, and
                this can cause physical and emotional changes. Pregnant women
                may experience nausea, fatigue, pain and mood swings. <br />It
                is also important for pregnant women to take care of their diet
                by consuming foods rich in essential nutrients such as
                vegetables, fruits, proteins and complex carbohydrates. Pregnant
                women should also drink enough water to maintain adequate
                hydration. <br />Rest is also important for pregnant women.
                Pregnant women should get enough sleep to rest and help maintain
                their energy and mood. Regular exercise is also recommended for
                pregnant women to maintain their physical and emotional health.
                <br />It is important that pregnant women receive regular
                prenatal care from trained health professionals. Prenatal visits
                allow healthcare professionals to monitor the health of the
                mother and fetus and identify any potential problems.
                <br />
                Finally, it is important for pregnant women to focus on their
                emotional well-being. Pregnancy can be a stressful time, so it's
                important for pregnant women to take time to relax and focus on
                their mental health. Pregnant women can talk to their partner,
                family, or healthcare professional for support. <br />In
                summary, pregnant women need to take care of their physical and
                emotional health to ensure a healthy and successful pregnancy.
                Regular prenatal care, a healthy diet, adequate sleep and
                regular exercise are key elements for a successful pregnancy.

              <p>
                <span>• Baby in society :</span> <br />
                Baby grows and must learn to live in society. Little by little,
                he will learn to behave appropriately with those around him. All
                babies are formed for life in society through a phase of
                opposition where they say "no" to everything, through rivalries
                between siblings, and by testing your limits (he lies, does
                stupid things, tries blackmail ). Be firm, but watch out for
                hurtful words you might say. And to fully understand your child,
                know how to analyze the father/daughter or father/son
                relationships, as well as his status as an only child, if
                applicable. <br />
                <br />
                <span>• Educate Baby :</span> <br />
                You have read and heard absolutely everything about parenting
                before becoming parents yourself. But once Baby arrived, you
                quickly understood that there was a world between theory and
                practice. At first, the basic rule to avoid conflicts with your
                Bout'chou is to avoid them with your spouse. It is likely that
                you did not receive the same education during your youth. Maybe
                he had strict parents and you had a rather "cool" and lax mom
                and dad. Nothing abnormal therefore to have different approaches
                to the education to be given to Baby. However, keep in mind that
                in front of your child, you must be one. Only one voice must be
                heard or you will lose all credibility with your child. Consult
                our article “education: when we disagree” to find out all about
                the subject. Dangerous games, education through “no”, swear
                words, hurtful comparisons… Discover all our other content

                <span>• Jealousy in Baby :</span> <br />
                Jealousy affects all age groups, but it is essentially that of
                children that we want to talk to you about. Generally, jealousy
                begins to set in in a family when a second child is on the way.
                And all the paradox is there. The eldest ardently wishes to have
                a little brother or a little sister and once granted, he finally
                wants to return it to the store or get rid of it altogether. A
                perfectly normal reaction since the eldest has by definition
                been the center of attention for months and months. The
                questions then swirl around in his head: do I still have the
                same place in the family? Do you still love me so much? Why do
                they take care of me a little less? In these cases, the best
                solution is still dialogue. There is no need to make your child
                feel guilty or risk exacerbating the tensions between the eldest
                and the youngest. Consult our special files to learn all about
                jealousy in children and also benefit from the answers of our
                experts to questions from Internet users. <br />
                <br />
                <span>• The opposition phase :</span> <br />
                Ah, the famous “opposing phase”, every parent’s nightmare. For
                those to whom the name does not mean anything, know that it
                designates the moment when your baby has only one word in his
                mouth: “no! A very large majority of toddlers go through this
                phase. It occurs around 18 months. According to specialists, it
                is nevertheless essential, for three reasons. On the one hand
                because it allows Baby to become aware of his own identity, but
                also to gain autonomy vis-à-vis his parents. Finally, the
                opposition phase allows him to test his parents and discover
                their limits... "The intensity of the opposition depends on the
                character of the child, but also, and perhaps above all, on the
                way in which the parents manage the crisis. Reveals child
                psychiatrist Bérengère Beauquier-Macotta. To discover our entire
                interview, consult our special file “Baby keeps saying no”. Then

                know everything about the opposition phase of children. <br />
                <br />
                <span>• Baby's fears :</span><br />
                If your child checks under his bed and in his closet daily
                before going to bed, he is certainly not quiet at night. Fear of
                the dark ? Afraid of a monster hiding somewhere? Don't worry,
                it's very common, most children try to delay bedtime every night
                to avoid being alone in the dark. But where does this frequent
                fear of darkness come from? Patricia Chalon, psychotherapist and
                early childhood specialist, offers you explanations and advice
                in our article entitled “Fear of the dark: how to reassure your
                child? ". Obviously, this fear of darkness can sometimes disturb
                Bout'chou's sleep, and therefore lead to nightmares. In our
                special file dedicated to bad dreams, you will discover their
                origin, and especially how to prevent them from coming back,
                using simple and effective methods. But children's fears don't
                always stem from sleep and darkness, water can also be a source
                of worry. <br />
                <br />
                <span>• Baby's character :</span> <br />
                Jealous, shy, bad player, depressed, funny... Your child
                necessarily has a dominant character trait. Take shyness, for
                example. Like all the other character traits mentioned above, it
                obviously has nothing hereditary. It is possible to overcome it
                if you do it well, without dramatizing the situation. Well yes,
                being shy is not a “fault”. Shyness can be linked to sensitivity
                or even respect. What attitude to adopt in public? Should you
                overprotect your child? How to avoid isolation? Find all our
                answers in our article entitled “Helping your child overcome his
                shyness”. Another well-known character trait in children (and
                not only for that matter): jealousy. “Being jealous is quite
                natural and even inevitable, reveals psychologist Lyliane
                Nemet-Pier. The main thing: do not let yourself be "devoured"
                and manage to live with this feeling. To achieve this result,

                Vaccinations are essential for babies and children. They provide
                effective and lasting protection against various serious
                infectious diseases, sometimes even fatal for the little ones.
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>• GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS</span> <br />
                Vaccinations against diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis,
                pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae b infection, hepatitis B,
                meningococcus C, pneumococcus, measles, mumps and rubella are
                compulsory for infants born in from January 1, 2018. <br />
                For children born before January 1, 2018, only vaccinations
                against diphtheria, tetanus and poliomyelitis were compulsory.
                Others were recommended. <br />
                Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) infections,
                recommended for girls since 2007, has also been recommended for
                boys since January 2021. It is recommended for girls and boys
                aged 11 to 14. <br />
                Vaccination against meningococcal B infections has been
                recommended since April 2022, with two doses followed by a
                booster dose. <br />
                Vaccination against rotavirus gastroenteritis has been
                recommended since June 2022. The vaccine is administered orally,
                in two or three doses depending on the vaccine.

            <h2>Ovarian syndrome.</h2>
            <div class="read-more-par">
              <p>
                Polycystic Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common hormonal disease
                in women of childbearing age. It can lead to fertility and hair
                disorders (hirsutism), as well as metabolic complications
                (diabetes). To date, there is no specific treatment. But ongoing
                research could be a game-changer by improving the still
                imperfect understanding of the mechanisms behind this disease.
                <br /><br />
                <span>SYMPTOMS OF POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME:</span> <br />
                Symptoms of PCOS usually appear in adolescence, around the time
                of the first period, but can also occur much later. They vary
                greatly from person to person and are not all felt with the same
                intensity. Indeed, SPOK can, in some women, be particularly
                disabling. <br />
                In addition, they are not necessarily all present, but each of
                them must however evoke the diagnosis of PCOS. <br />
                <br />
                <span>• Disruption of the menstrual cycle :</span> <br />
                Irregular menstrual cycles, which last more than 35 to 40 days
                and this, since adolescence; even by the total absence of
                periods (amenorrhea). <br /><br />
                <span>• Periods :</span> <br />
                It is composed of 2 phases separated by ovulation: <br />
                <u>Follicular phase</u>, ovulation, <u>Luteal phase</u> <br />
                In PCOS, the basal level of LH is abnormally high in the
                majority of cases. But it does not increase in the middle of the
                cycle when it is this phenomenon that triggers ovulation.
                <br /><br />
                <span>• Hyperandrogenism :</span> <br />
                In the presence of PCOS, the ovaries secrete too many androgens
                and particularly testosterone. From puberty, this disturbance
                can be responsible for: <br />
                hyperpilosity, even hirsutism in 70% of women then presenting
                with excess hair on the face, chest, back, buttocks; oily skin
                and the appearance of acne in adolescence and which persists
                after the age of 20; hair loss (alopecia) on the top of the
                skull and at the level of the frontal gulfs. <br />
                <br />
                <span>• Other Associated Symptoms in PCOS :</span> <br />
                Other associated symptoms may occur but remain inconsistent,
                such as: dark spots that appear on the skin, most often on the
                back of the neck, under the arms and in the groin area (inner
                thighs). They are called "acanthosis nigricans" and are the
                consequence of a high level of insulin; depressed mood; anxiety;
                sleep apnea especially in case of overweight. <br />
                <br />
                The treatment of PCOS is only symptomatic and this until
                menopause. It is based on an improvement in lifestyle, drug
                treatment in the event of hirsutism and/or infertility, and
                psychological support when necessary. <br />In case of
                overweight, a loss of about 10% of the initial weight reduces
                hyperandrogenism and shows a beneficial effect on amenorrhea,
                with a potential benefit on fertility. In the longer term, this
                weight loss will have a positive impact on the risk of metabolic
                complications associated with PCOS. On the other hand, for women
                whose weight is normal, losing weight does not bring any
                benefit. <br />In case of hirsutism, an estrogen-progestogen
                pill is recommended as first-line treatment. Its progestogen
                component inhibits the secretion of LH and reduces the
                production of ovarian androgens. The estrogenic component
                decreases the level of circulating androgens. If the
                estrogen-progestogen pill fails, treatment is based on an
                anti-androgen (cyproterone acetate) combined with a natural
                estrogen. Cyproterone acetate is effective in three months on
                acne and in six months on hirsutism. <br />As for metabolic
                abnormalities, they are treated by first-line dietary and
                lifestyle measures, then by oral antidiabetic drugs if
                necessary.

            <h2>Breast cancer.</h2>
            <div class="read-more-par">
              <p>
                Breast cancer results from a disruption of certain cells which
                multiply and most often form a mass called a tumour. There are
                different types that do not evolve in the same way. Some are
                “aggressive” and evolve very quickly, others more slowly. Cancer
                cells can remain in the breast. They can also spread to other
                organs which is an even more threatening situation. We then
                speak of metastases. In the majority of cases, the development
                of breast cancer takes several months or even years.
                <br />Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. It
                accounts for more than a third of all new cases of cancer in
                women. Symptoms of breast cancer are: <br />
                a hard mass in a breast, fixed or mobile, often with irregular
                contours, swollen and hard lymph nodes, not painful, in the
                armpit, spontaneous discharge from one of the two nipples, a
                change in a nipple or the appearance of the breast skin. When
                breast cancer has spread to the rest of the body, other symptoms
                may appear: fatigue, nausea, weight loss, bone pain or vision
                problems.
